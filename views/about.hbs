                Hey, what's up?
            </p>
            <p>
                My name is Michael Lee, I live in Anchorage, Alaska, and I occasionally go outside when the sun's out. I've always loved art and technology so naturally I'm doing the thing that's the best of both worlds: web development!

                I'm interested in real time applications and the implications it has on our everyday lives. The technology that has enabled us to easily share information has changed us so fundamentally that even our needs have changed.
            </p>
            <p>
                I believe that we've only scratched the surface of what technology can do for communication and culture, and that there are opportunities for all of us to take part in building the internet for <strong> everyone</strong>.

                I'm much more comfortable on the back end. I started web development in Python with Django a while back but now, I focus most of my time on Ruby and Javascript. I'm not a designer but I do enjoy dissecting web applications to understand what makes them so good. I often employ my tastes and critical eye to examine how and in what way something can be improved. That being said, I like simple and minimalistic designs on apps with strong functionality.

                Data is really fascinating. Our ability to transmit information over a network of copper wires using electromagnetic waves and not have it degenerate blows my mind everyday. We use brilliant abstractions to simulate behaviors like privacy and security but to have such simple components make something so complex... It really seems like magic. Are we living in the Matrix?
